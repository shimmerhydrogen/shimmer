A_GRID_CREATOR:

LL_inner = size of each branck k
LL_pipe  = size of a pipe in each branch. More or less, dx = L/num_grid_pts
lung =

To improve
LLpipe doesnot need to be computed inside the loop. Take advantage of Vectorisation operations
There is not need to do xx in branch. It could just be enough given a name to each row of xx.
ex: branch.xx(1) = branch.positions
